                Mike Massimino is a four-time spacewalker on two missions to the Hubble Space Telescope, including the
                final Hubble servicing mission which has been called the most dangerous and complex mission in space
                shuttle history. But he is more than an astronaut – he is a recurring character on The Big Bang Theory,
                a bestselling author, an engineering professor, an MIT Ph.D, and a popular guest on news and late-night
                television programs. Mike uses humor and his unique storytelling ability to inspire audiences to
                identify the passion in their work, use teamwork and innovation to solve problems, provide leadership in
                the face of adversity and change, and never give up when pursuing a goal. Mike has written 3 books
                including his NY Times Bestselling memoir Spaceman, and his most recent book Moonshot: A NASA
                Astronaut’s Guide to Achieving the Impossible which distills stories and insights from NASA into an
                actionable guide for success in business and in life. Mike is clear, “We all have our own personal “moon
                shots” we’d like to take in life, but as mission control will tell you, doing one big thing really means
                getting a thousand little things right along the way.”

                Mike never gives the same talk twice, and enjoys working with each client to craft a talk that will
                include stories that will hit the mark for their event. Find a few examples of past topics below.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Be Ready for the Future</h3>
            <h4>Change is inevitable, accept and embrace it</h4>
            <p>
                Companies go through reorganizations and changes to grow their business and prepare for future
                opportunities in the changing marketplace. Often these transformations are met with resistance by team
                members who are happy with the way things are, but leadership needs to clearly communicate the benefits
                of these changes to gain buy-in. Mike relates changes in the space program to changes in today’s
                business world. During his career, NASA pivoted from working independently to embarking on global
                partnerships with the space faring countries of the world including Russia, and commercial partnerships
                with private space companies. Leadership made it clear that although many would be uncomfortable with
                these changes, they were needed to secure the future of space exploration, improve international
                relations, and stimulate a new space economy. Mike encourages audiences that although they may have an
                initial reluctance to accept change, they should embrace it as an opportunity for future greatness and
                success.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Being Resilient and Adaptable in Challenging Times</h3>
            <h4>When you think all hope is lost, find another way around</h4>
            <p>
                Sometimes forces out of our control can make moving forward difficult. In spite of our best efforts we
                often get knocked down repeatedly. But we need to find a way around that next obstacle. Mike encourages
                audiences: When the odds are against you, do it anyway. Mike’s dream of becoming an astronaut began when
                he was six years old watching Neil Armstrong take the first steps on the moon. The path to achieving
                this dream was wrought with unexpected challenges, failures, disappointments, and self-doubt. Mike was
                rejected three times by NASA including a medical disqualification which Mike overcame by teaching his
                eyes and brain to “see better.” His persistence paid off when he was selected to be an astronaut on his
                fourth try. This same resilience was needed after earning his astronaut wings to persevere through the
                setbacks, tragedies, and technical challenges that Mike experienced in his astronaut career. Mike
                stresses that as long as you keep trying, no matter the obstacles, achieving a goal is possible.
            </p>


            <h3 class="major">The Team’s Success is Your Success</h3>
            <h4>You cannot do this alone, you will succeed or fail as a team</h4>
            <p>
                An organization’s goals are only obtainable if everyone on the team works together. Individual
                accomplishments are needed, but the success of the team is most important. In our complex world, not
                everyone can be good at everything. But by pooling our abilities, we can be good at everything as a
                team. Mike conveys how he and his colleagues worked together with a culture of admitting mistakes and
                bringing forward concerns without worry of embarrassment or finger pointing. Providing help to teammates
                was not considered to be a burden, but rather a way to make the team stronger. When Mike broke a
                critical piece of equipment while repairing the Hubble Space Telescope during his final spacewalk, his
                team was there to help. Rather than blaming Mike, the ground control team and the astronauts in space
                worked together with him to come up with an innovative solution that saved the day and the mission.
                Although not every problem has an obvious solution, teamwork can help us with overcoming unforeseen
                challenges. Mike communicates to audiences how the NASA models for teamwork and leadership can be
                applied to the business world and in life. When you need help, reach out to your own “Mission Control
                Center,” and be “Mission Control” for others.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Gaining that Competitive Edge</h3>
            <h4>Accepting AI and new technology in the workplace</h4>
            <p>
                AI and new technology is all around us. It can be intimidating. But it can also provide opportunities
                for growth and improve our decision making. The Space Shuttle was a manually controlled spacecraft. Very
                little computing power was available and astronauts and flight controllers were responsible for
                operations and decision making during high stakes situations. In today’s spaceships, AI performs many of
                the decision making tasks previously done by astronauts. But the path getting there was not easy as
                astronauts were accustomed to being in total control of their spacecraft. The road to acceptance was
                through demonstrated benefits such as increased safety, improved performance, and reduced training time.
                Mike encourages audiences to embrace new technologies and AI to give them the competitive edge they need
                in meeting the challenges of a dynamic and uncertain world.

            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Innovating for an Uncharted Future</h3>
            <h4>Make your workplace a laboratory where everyone has a voice</h4>
            <p>
                In the challenging world in which we live and work, the problems we face are complex. Growing our
                businesses in an uncharted future requires innovation. Mike found that innovation at NASA came through
                diversity of thought, and everyone having a voice. If everyone thought the same way we would have never
                landed on the moon. To prepare for their spacewalks, Mike and his team trained in the largest pool in
                the world - The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. At first Mike was confused as to why the facility was
                called a “laboratory.” A more appropriate name seemed to be “really big pool.” But after time, Mike
                realized that it was a laboratory - a place where innovative ideas would be put forward and tested.
                During a training session, if the team could figure out a way to save even one minute of spacewalking
                time it would be a significant accomplishment. And everyone had a voice, including the new people. Not
                all ideas were good, but leadership never crushed those ideas. They responded with “thank you” and “keep
                bringing ideas forward.” Because once you crush an idea, the person is likely to stay silent in the
                future, and the team will not get the useful idea when it eventually comes. Mike is clear: innovation is
                only possible when a diverse group of people exchange ideas and everyone has a voice. Mike shares
                examples of how this approach worked when he was a rookie, and when he was the leader of a team trying
                to uncover innovative ways to meet current and future challenges in space.

                people. “I used my 30 seconds, I got over it and we have to move on.” I can’t tell you how many times

                Normally when you hire an external speaker to close out an event, there is usually a good size drop-off
                of people who are trying to catch a flight out of town. Not in our case. I looked around the room when
                Mike started and it was close to being as crowded as day 1 of the event (roughly 1300 people). Also,
                afterwards, Mike signed his books for attendees, and we estimate that 500+ were in line to get a book
